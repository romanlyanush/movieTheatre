This project is going test my data structures skill and yours too. The movie theatre system is going to let the users choose from the range of movies.
The user will pick a film, and the program will ask for the age of the user. If they (users) are old enough to watch a film AND if
there are seats available – the program will let the users complete the ticket purchase. On the other hand, if there are no seats available
for the selected movie OR the user is not old enough to see the movie he/she picked, the system will let the purchase go thru OR notify users
what was the reason they could not complete the purchase of the movie tickets.
This project shows how variable, logic and data structures are all tied together to build functioning programs! Pretty cool, isn’t it?
